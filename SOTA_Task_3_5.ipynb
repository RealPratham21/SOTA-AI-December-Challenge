        "\n",
        "This notebook presents a complete, phase-wise solution to the inverse question–answering task posed in the SOTA-AI December Challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to reconstruct plausible, exam-style questions given answers generated by a large language model. Since the original questions are unavailable and evaluation is based on semantic similarity rather than exact string matching, the task requires reasoning about intent, meaning, and the inversion of the question–answer relationship rather than surface-level text matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution is organized into clearly defined stages:\n",
        "1. Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset  \n",
        "2. Constructing a synthetic supervision signal from unlabeled answers  \n",
        "3. Fine-tuning a language model using parameter-efficient methods  \n",
        "4. Generating questions for the test set  \n",
        "5. Performing selective semantic repair using cycle consistency  \n",
        "6. Auditing outputs and preparing the final submission  \n",
        "\n",
        "All stages are designed to be conceptually complete and reproducible. For practical execution under constrained compute environments, the same logic can be applied in batches by operating on subsets of the data. Since all processing steps are independent per example, batch-wise execution yields identical results to a single end-to-end run, and final outputs are obtained by aggregating and ordering these batches deterministically.\n",

He believed that clear and precise language was essential for the advancement of science and that equivocation was a major obstacle to this goal.\\n\\nIn his work \\\"Novum Organum\\\" (The New Instrument), Bacon proposed a method for analyzing language that involved breaking down words and phrases into their constituent parts and examining their meanings in detail.

According to Goodman, the objects of architectural notation can be interpreted in the following ways:\\n\\n1. **Syntactic interpretation**: This involves understanding the rules and conventions governing the use of architectural symbols and notations. It's about recognizing the relationships between different elements, such as the way lines, shapes, and symbols are combined to convey meaning.\\n2. **Semantic interpretation**: This involves understanding the meaning of individual symbols and notations within the context of the architectural notation system. It's about recognizing the concepts and ideas that the symbols represent, such as the meaning of a particular line style or the function of a specific symbol.\\n3. **Syntactic-semantic interpretation**: This involves combining syntactic and semantic interpretation to understand how the symbols and notations are used to convey meaning. It's about recognizing the relationships between symbols and notations, as well as their individual meanings, to understand the overall meaning of the architectural notation.\\n4. **Iconic interpretation**: This involves understanding the symbols and notations as representations of the physical world.

            "REGENERATED ANSWER (truncated): In Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, altruism and self-interest are intertwined. Eudaimonia, often translated as happiness or flourishing, is achieved when an individual cultivates virtues and lives a life of moral character. Aristotle argues that true happiness and fulfillment come from living a life of virtue, which involves both personal growth and contributing to the greater good.\n",

            "REGENERATED ANSWER (truncated): The EPR paradox, proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, challenges the concept of locality in quantum mechanics. It suggests that if two particles are entangled, measuring the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This seems to imply that information can travel faster than light, violating the principle of locality.\n",

It involves checking whether the conjunction of two instances of the sentence would be true if the original sentence were true. \\n\\nRyle's critics argue that the conjunction reduction test is not a reliable method for determining the meaning of systematically misleading expressions. They claim that it can lead to incorrect conclusions and that it does not take into account the nuances of language.\\n\\nOne of the main criticisms is that the test can be sensitive to the order in which the instances are conjoined. This means that the test can produce different results depending on the order in which the instances are combined, which can lead to inconsistent conclusions.\\n\\nAdditionally, some critics argue that the test relies too heavily on the idea that the meaning of a sentence can be determined by its truth conditions, which is a simplification of the complexities of language. They argue that language is more nuanced and that the meaning of a sentence cannot be reduced to its truth conditions alone.\\n\\nOverall, Ryle's use of the conjunction reduction test has been criticized for its limitations\",\n          \"I'm not aware of any information about a specific Comrie (1985) paper or work that discusses the sufficiency of speech time and event time in the analysis of absolute tense. However, I can provide some general information about the topic.\\n\\nAccording to Bernard Comrie's work on tense and aspect, he discusses the distinction between relative tense (which is relative to the speech time) and absolute tense (which is relative to the event time). \\n\\nIn the context of absolute tense, Comrie (1985) may have proposed that speech time and event time are not sufficient to account for the meaning of absolute tense. Instead, he may have argued that absolute tense requires a more complex analysis that takes into account the relationship between the event time and the speech time, as well as other factors such as the aspectual properties of the verb.\\n\\nHowever, without more specific information about the Comrie (1985) paper or work, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer. If you have any more context or information about the paper or work you are referring to, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 505,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is the primary difference between the Intentionalist View and the Functional View of artifact function?\",\n          \"How does Mary Astell's concept of experience influencing reasoning abilities differ from John Locke's tabula rasa theory?\",\n          \"What were the three logical works by Aristotle that Ibn Rushd wrote commentaries on?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cycle_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.15004166821223017,\n        \"min\": 0.0292817503213882,\n        \"max\": 0.9455724954605104,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 505,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9048281908035278,\n          0.8056882619857788,\n          0.8433416485786438\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The development of productive practices within a mode of production is shaped by the structural relationships between different elements of the system, such as the relations of production, the forces of production, and the superstructure.\\n\\nAlthusser argues that the development of productive practices is not a linear or teleological process, but rather a complex and contradictory one. He identifies several key mechanisms that shape the development of productive practices, including:\\n\\n1. **Structural causality**: The relationships between different elements of the mode of production are causal, meaning that they shape and determine the development of productive practices. For example, the relations of production (such as the ownership of the means of production) shape the development of the forces of production (such as technology and labor).\\n2. **Overdetermination**: The development of productive practices is overdetermined, meaning that it is\",\n          \"I'm not aware of any text that explains the problem of Jesus' body being in two places at once. However, I can provide some context and possible explanations related to this topic.\\n\\nThe problem you're referring to might be related to the biblical account of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. According to the New Testament, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross and placed in a tomb. However, on the third day, his tomb was found empty, and his body was not there.\\n\\nOne possible explanation for this is the concept of the resurrection, which is central to Christian theology. According to this view, Jesus' body was not just physically resurrected, but also spiritually transformed, allowing him to be present in multiple places at once.\\n\\nAnother possible explanation is the concept of the \\\"empty tomb,\\\" which suggests that Jesus' body was not actually in the tomb, but rather was taken by others, such as his disciples or the Roman guards.\\n\\nHowever, without more context or information about the specific text you're referring to, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation.\\n\\nIf you could provide more information or clarify which text you're referring to, I'd be happy to try and help further.\",\n          \"I'm not aware of any information about a \\\"linguistic return\\\" in metaphysics proposed by Huw Price.

He has written extensively on the topics of time, causation, and the nature of reality.\\n\\nOne of his notable works is \\\"Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point: New Directions for Lessons from Physics\\\" (1996), where he discusses the concept of time and its relationship to causation. He also wrote \\\"Metaphysics After Kant: The Two Standpoints of the Mind and the World\\\" (2007), which explores the relationship between the mind and the world.\\n\\nWhile I couldn't find any specific information about a \\\"linguistic return\\\" in metaphysics proposed by Huw Price, it's possible that he may have discussed a similar idea in one of his works.

This can lead to subtle but critical alignment failures in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Concept Drift**: As the model learns from new data, its internal representations may adapt to capture new patterns or relationships that were not present in the original training data. However, these new representations may not align with the original intent of the model, leading to misclassifications or incorrect predictions.\\n\\n2. **Feature Shift**: Changes in the environment or data distribution can cause the model to learn new features that are not relevant to the original task. For example, a model trained to recognize images of dogs may learn to recognize the presence of a specific type of dog bed as a feature, rather than the actual dog.\\n\\n3. **Overfitting**: As the model continues to learn from new data, it may overfit to the specific patterns in the data, rather than generalizing to the underlying concept. This can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data.\\n\\n4. **Conceptual Drift**: Changes in the underlying concept or task can cause the model to learn new representations that are not aligned with the original intent. For example, a model trained\",\n          \"The 'goal-formation problem' in AI alignment refers to the challenge of ensuring that an artificial intelligence (AI) system forms goals that align with human values and intentions. This problem arises when the AI system is designed to optimize a specific objective function, but the objective function itself may not accurately capture the desired goals or values.\\n\\nThe goal-formation problem differs from specifying a fixed objective function in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Objective function vs. goal formation**: A fixed objective function is a mathematical function that defines a specific goal or outcome to be optimized. In contrast, the goal-formation problem involves the AI system itself determining its goals or objectives, which may not be explicitly specified by the objective function.\\n2. **Alignment with human values**: The goal-formation problem requires that the AI system's goals align with human values and intentions, whereas a fixed objective function may not necessarily capture these values.\\n3. **Flexibility and adaptability**: The goal-formation problem involves the AI system adapting to changing circumstances and learning to form goals that are relevant to the current situation. A fixed objective function, on the other hand, is typically a static function that is applied uniformly across all situations.\\n4. **Value drift**: The goal-formation problem raises concerns about value drift, where the\",\n          \"Predictive processing is a theoretical framework in neuroscience that suggests the brain is primarily engaged in prediction and error minimization. This framework has been influential in understanding various aspects of cognition, perception, and decision-making. When applied to AI alignment, the principle of predictive processing can inform the development of robust meta-reasoning capabilities in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Error-driven learning**: In predictive processing, the brain continuously updates its internal models to minimize prediction errors. Similarly, AI systems can be designed to learn from errors and update their meta-reasoning strategies to improve performance. This can be achieved through techniques like meta-learning, where the AI system learns to learn from its own experiences and adapt to new situations.\\n2. **Hierarchical prediction**: The brain's predictive processing is organized in a hierarchical manner, with higher-level predictions built upon lower-level ones. AI systems can be designed to mimic this hierarchical structure, with meta-reasoning capabilities that integrate information from multiple levels of abstraction. This can help AI systems to reason about their own reasoning and make more informed decisions.\\n3. **Active inference**: In predictive processing, the brain actively infers the causes of sensory input to update its internal models.

        "\n",
        "After initial generation and selective semantic repair, the majority of reconstructed questions achieved strong semantic alignment with their corresponding answers. However, a small tail of examples still exhibited relatively low cycle-consistency scores (≤ 0.67).\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than retraining models or applying broad changes, a targeted final repair phase was introduced to address only these low-confidence cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "- Low cycle scores typically arise from underspecified or overly generic questions.\n",
        "- These cases often require stronger intent inference rather than additional training.\n",
        "- Since evaluation is semantic, improving the weakest tail can significantly increase robustness and overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach\n",
        "For each example with a cycle score ≤ 0.67:\n",
        "- A **strong inverse-QA prompt** is used with a base instruction-tuned language model.\n",
        "- The prompt explicitly emphasizes reconstructing the *original* exam question that directly caused the answer.\n",
        "- Exactly one new candidate question is generated.\n",
        "- The new question is evaluated using the same cycle-consistency metric.\n",
        "- The original question is replaced **only if** the new cycle score is strictly higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Properties\n",
        "- This process is deterministic and per-example independent.\n",
        "- High-quality questions are never overwritten.\n",
        "- Improvements are monotonic by construction.\n",
        "\n",
        "This final tail-focused refinement substantially improves semantic alignment in difficult cases, leading to a cleaner distribution of scores and a stronger overall submission.\n"

        "This notebook presents a complete, principled solution to the inverse question–answering task in the SOTA-AI December Challenge. Starting from an unlabeled dataset of model-generated answers, the approach progressively builds structure through synthetic supervision, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, deterministic inference, and targeted semantic repair.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key takeaways from this work include:\n",
        "- Inverse QA is fundamentally a semantic reasoning problem rather than a surface-form generation task.\n",
        "- Small, high-quality synthetic datasets can be more effective than large noisy ones when combined with careful filtering.\n",
        "- Cycle consistency serves as a practical proxy for semantic alignment and enables safe, monotonic post-processing.\n",
        "- Selective tail-focused refinement can substantially improve robustness without risking regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "All stages of the pipeline are designed to be modular, interpretable, and reproducible. While practical execution may involve batch-wise processing under constrained resources, the methodology itself is conceptually complete and generalizes to the full dataset.\n",
